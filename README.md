## PDF Summarization with Mistral-7B

This application includes a powerful PDF summarization feature that uses the Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 Large Language Model to generate concise summaries of your PDF documents.

### How to Use PDF Summarization

1. **Navigate to Notes**: Go to the Notes section of the application.
2. **Create a New Note**: Click on "Create New Note".
3. **Upload a PDF**: Use the upload area to select a PDF file from your computer.
4. **Click "Summarize with AI"**: Once your PDF is uploaded, click the "Summarize with AI" button.
5. **Configure Summarization Options**:
   - **Summary Length**: Choose between short (1-2 paragraphs), medium (3-5 paragraphs), or long (comprehensive).
   - **Summary Style**: Choose between concise, detailed, or bullet points.
   - **Focus Area**: Choose between general overview, key concepts, or technical details.
6. **Generate Summary**: Click the "Generate Summary" button to start the summarization process.
7. **Review and Edit**: The generated summary will be added to your note content. You can review and edit it as needed.
8. **Save Note**: Click "Save Note" to save your note with the PDF and generated summary.

### Setup Mistral-7B for Local Summarization

For the full PDF summarization experience, you'll need to set up Mistral-7B locally:

1. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Download the Mistral-7B Model**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/mistral_models/7B-Instruct-v0.3
   python -c "from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download; from pathlib import Path; mistral_models_path = Path.home().joinpath('mistral_models', '7B-Instruct-v0.3'); mistral_models_path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True); snapshot_download(repo_id='mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3', allow_patterns=['params.json', 'consolidated.safetensors', 'tokenizer.model.v3'], local_dir=mistral_models_path)"
   ```

3. **Verify Installation**:
   The model files should be located in `~/mistral_models/7B-Instruct-v0.3/`.

4. **Start the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

If the Mistral model is not found or cannot be loaded, the application will fall back to a simulation mode that provides example summaries.

## Development
